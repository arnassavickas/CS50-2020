**About CS50 2020 course**

This course was my very first introduction to programming. After reading a lot of positive reviews on the internet about the superiority of the free Harvard's Univerisity Introduction to Computer Science CS50 course, I have finally decided to try my luck and see if I like it.

## Impressions

Eventually, CS50 sparked my interest in programming. Before that, programming seemed to me like some very uninteresting gibberish, but just after the first problem set on C language, I have understood, that programming is almost just like playing puzzle games, which I actually like.

Pset 1-5: The course started with introducing to the very basics like bits and bytes, ASCII, etc. First five problem sets were done using **C** language. With all it's nuances like pointers, it was quite difficult to grasp totally new concepts of programming language.

Pset 6: I was introduced **Python**, which felt like a huge relief. Problems, that were solved previously with tens of lines of code, now can be done with just a few lines.
Pset 7: Learnt how to write **SQLite** queries using joins and intersects.
Pset 8: Great introduction to web - **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap** library. Started to use **Flask** for the backend to create some web apps.

## Folders

Each folder is dedicated for each course's problem set, thus named pset1, pset2 etc.
